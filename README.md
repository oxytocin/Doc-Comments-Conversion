# Doc Comments Conversion

If you are not already familiar with the Doc Comments plugin, see [here](https://github.com/oxytocin/DocComments). It allows you to make inline annotations in Neovim that are stored in a separate file and signified by highlights.

This repository contains a couple scripts to convert a text file + its corresponding Doc Comments file into a docx file and vice versa. In theory, if someone sent you a commented docx file, you could convert and read it in Neovim, make your own comments with Doc Comments, and export back to docx.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
- [Doc Comments](https://github.com/oxytocin/DocComments) if you want to actually see comments or make new comments in the converted text file.

## Scripts
- docx_to_md.py: `docx_to_md.py in_file [out_filename]` Convert docx to a text file and corresponding Doc Comments file. As with the original plugin, the Doc Comments file will be created with a name of .[original_filename]_comments and therefore will be hidden. If not specified, the output filename will be the same as the input filename but with a .md extension.
- md_to_docx.py: `md_to_docx.py in_file [out_filename]` Convert text to docx, preserving comments made in Doc Comments. Note that you only need to provide the path to the text file; the script will automatically find the corresponding Doc Comments file based on the filename. If not specified, the output filename will be the same as the input filename but with a .docx extension.

## Limitations
- Comments will be converted with "Unknown Author" and a fixed date. I am not sure what will happen if you use these scripts on a docx file that has suggestions.
